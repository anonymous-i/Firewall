# Firewall
Illustrates the scenario of the working of a firewall system between a set of hosts using the rule sets that are fed to the system. Firstly we implement a simple firewall, which relies on the idea of pre-coded/hot coded rules using conditional statements. Then we try to implement a more advanced and sophisticated system that works on the dynamic set of rules and defines a complete firewall system that provides rule management (CRUD of Rule sets), Command line interface for user interaction. We then also benchmark the designed system across a set of parameters and determine the PPS (Packets Per Second) processing by the system by plotting a set of graphs. The system is further extended to employ the DoS attack detection mechanism.
